Total changelog (1.3.3):

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 

The mod has been upgraded to BepInEx 670 (now compatible with other GTFO mods!)
... This does mean you will need to upgrade. A new BepInEx version has been linked in the readme. The mod will NOT work without upgrading! 
... Other mods might overwrite your BepInEx version. This will break things!
The BepInEx version shipped with other mods will NOT work at this time! 

- Fix laser disappearing in thermal sights when starting multiple missions without restarting
- Fixed shotguns firing at look direction
- Made shockwave integration disabled by default, as it has been known to cause issues. If you run into any, let us know!
- Improved efficiency of rendering by improving the hidden area mesh and skipping some work that is the same for both eyes.
- Made hidden area mesh toggleable, as it might cause artifacting on some setups (edges of screen not rendering)
- Removed an outdated config option (skip damage feedback)
- Added TactVisor bhaptics support
- Ported bhaptics to the new bhaptics SDK, which should resolve any leftover crashing
- Fixed drop-in sequence auto-skipping
- Total melee hit detection overhaul by Roughy! Melee weapons should feel much better now.
- Added FPS limit in menu. This is a possible fix for the menu stutter issue. Let us know if it still happens! 
- Made Bhaptics and shockwave integrations optional. You can now disable/enable these whenever. 
- Fixed and improved Accrat ND6 heavy SMG sight
- Fixed menu issues where high HMD resolutions would prevent UI at the edges of the screen from being accessible.
- Fixed BHaptics related issues.
- Added Shockwave suit integration
- Added ProtubeVR Haptics support
- Tweaked every weapon in the game to have its own haptics 'identity'
- Fixed the following weapon sights:
* Drekker Pres MOD 556 Rifle
* Techman Arbalist machine gun
* Techman Klust 6 Burst Cannon


Known issues:
- GTFO is very VRAM hungry! If your texture or render resolution settings are too high and you're using too much VRAM your game will be very unstable!
  Changing resolution in-game or even playing some maps might cause crashes depending on your resolution and/or texture resolution settings!

- For Quest headsets: Link/airlink are very crash-prone. Playing using VD is recommended.
